# PotterPi
Take home the magic of the wizarding world of Harry Potter!  
## Hardware
1. Raspberry Pi 3B+ 
2. Night vision camera 
   - I recommend getting a USB camera that already has IR lights included, but you could get any camera without an IR filter and get IR LEDs separately. 
   That will, however, require more setup.
3. Interactive wizard wand 
   - If you don't have an official interactive wand, you can DIY this with any wand-like object and a retroreflective bead.
4. IR pass filter (optional)
   - This isn't strictly necessary, but it will increase accuracy by filtering out a lot of visible light. You can buy filters on Amazon, but you can also use unexposed, developed film as a DIY IR pass filter.
